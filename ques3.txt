In JavaScript, operators can be categorized based on the number of operands they work with:
1.UNARY OPERATORS:
        Definition:Unary operators operate on a single operand.
        Example:
        let x=5;
        let y=-x;//Unary minus operators
        In this example, the '-' sign is a unary operator that negates the value of x.
2.BINARY OPERATORS:
        Definition:Binary operators operate on two operands.
        Example:
          let a=10;
          let b=5;
          let sum=a+b;//Binary plus operator
          here, the '+' sign is a binary operator that adds the values of 'a' and 'b'
3.TERNARY OPERATORS:
        Definition:The ternary operator is the short-hand way of writing an if-else statement in a single line.
        Syntax: Condition ? Expression1:Expression2;
        Example : let age=20;
                  let status=(age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
                  In this example, the ternary operator checks if the variable 'age' is greater than or equal to 18.
                  If true, it assigns the value "Adult" to the status variable otherwise, it assigns "Minor"
