Choosing the meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readibility, maintainability
and collaboration. Clear identifiers convey the purpose and content of variables, making it easier to developers to understand
the code both during development and when returining to it later.
Here's an example to illustrate the importance of meaningful variable names
 Non-Descriptive variable names
     let x=10;
     let y=5;
     let z=x+y;
     //What does z represnts 
     In this example, the varaible name 'x' and 'y' and 'z' are not descriptive. Its unclear what these variables 
     represent or what the purpose of the calcualtion without additional context.
Descriptive Variable names
  let numberOfApples=10;
  let numberOfOranges=5;
  let totalFruits=numberOfApples+numberOfOranges;
  //clearly indicates the purpose of the calcualtion
  Importance of Descriptive Variable names:
  1. Readability
  2. maintainability
  3. Communication
  4. Avoiding Ambigiuity
