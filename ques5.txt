Comments in JavaScript serve as annotations within the code to explain its functionality, improve readibility, and 
provide insights for developers who may work or mantain the code in the future.
They dont affect the actual execution of the code but are valuable for documentation and communication.
Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in javascript:
   Single Line Comments:
   //This is a single comment
   let age=25;//variable age stores the users age
   In this example double slash (//) on that line is considered a comment.
   Multi Line Comments 
   /*  
       This is a multi-line comment
       It can span mutliple lines
       Used for more extensive explanations or commnents
    */
    let name="John";
    In this example the comment enclosed between '/*' and '*/' are multi line comments.
    Importance of Comments are:
    1. documentation
    2. Debugging made easy
    3. Clarity and readibility
    4. Communication.
